// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has 
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + ' the great';
    }
}
function show_magicians(Magicians) {
    for (var _i = 0, Magicians_1 = Magicians; _i < Magicians_1.length; _i++) {
        var magician = Magicians_1[_i];
        console.log(magician.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + magician.slice(1));
    }
}
var magicians2 = ["Burhan", "Usman", "Zeeshan"];
make_great(magicians2);
show_magicians(magicians2);
